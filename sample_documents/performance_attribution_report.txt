PERFORMANCE ATTRIBUTION METHODOLOGY

The Brinson-Hood-Beebower attribution methodology is used to decompose excess returns into allocation and selection effects:

Allocation Effect = (wp - wb) × rb
Selection Effect = wb × (rp - rb)
Interaction Effect = (wp - wb) × (rp - rb)

Where:
wp = portfolio weight in sector
wb = benchmark weight in sector  
rp = portfolio return in sector
rb = benchmark return in sector
